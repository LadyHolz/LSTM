# LSTM
LSTM Using Keras, NumPy,  Pandas, SkLearn, Matplotlib

As we are using anaconda NumPy, Pandas and Math should already be installed notes: now using colab 2022
If you have an issues import them, open terminal and try a pip install #update 2022 all pre installed in colab
pip install Panda / Data manipulation and Analysis
pip install python-math
pip install NumPy / Mathematicl Operations
You will need to stall the following:
pip install pandas-datareader / no longer working for yahoo stocks
pip install matplotlib / Visualization
pip install keras / API / library for deep learning model Tensorflow
pip install -U scikit-learn / Data Predictive tool
Minmaxscaler / Transforms each feature
io / Data Extraction : unstructured / semi structured into tables
